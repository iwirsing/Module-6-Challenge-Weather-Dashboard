## <u>Web Application Features</u>

1. The user enters a city and the application displays the current weather using icons and a few parameters.
2. The background color of the day's forecast changes according to the weather. A clear would get a shade of yellow, rain would get a share of purple while clouds would get a shade of gray.
3. Every time the user searches the weather for a city, the city is saved in the localStorage and also displayed as a button for the user to access the weather in the future.
4. If the user searches for a city that has already been searched, the application will create an alert that it already has been searched.
5. A 'Clear Saved Data' button appears when searched cities start to populate the page. This button will clear the saved cities and also the data in the localStorage.
